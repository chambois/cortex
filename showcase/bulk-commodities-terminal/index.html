    <h2>Bulk Commodities Terminal: Appleton Dock, Port Melbourne</h2>

    <p>Cortex, together with its joint venture partner Walter Construction Pty
    Ltd, designed and constructed Australia\'s premier bulk export terminal at
    Appleton Dock in the Port of Melbourne. This facility represents a major
    investment by a joint venture between Australian Bulk Alliance (ABA) and
    AWB (formerly the Australian Wheat Board).</p>
    
    <p>The facility is primarily designed to load grain into vessels ranging
    up to Panamax size. However, it has been constructed to handle a wide
    range of bulk materials other than grain. The total on-site storage
    capacity is 50,000 tonnes and is configured in a range of steel, conical
    bottomed silos and flat bottomed silos.</p>

    <p>Grain enters the terminal via road and rail. Most grain is exported to
    ship via a retractable, luffing boom shiploader. Grain is also exported
    from the terminal for domestic use via a road outloading facility.</p>
