    <h2>Port Adelaide Ship loader</h2>

    <p>CORTEX Resources Pty Ltd designed and constructed a mobile 1000tph
    mineral sands handling ship-loading system for Flinders Ports venture and
    delivered it to operate at Inner Harbor, Port Adelaide, South Australia.
    The system includes:
      <ul>
        <li> Cortex mobile tip truck dump feeder</li>
        <li>Cortex mobile rubber tyred tricycle wheel mounted self-propelled
        ship-loader</li>
        <li>DSI designed Snake Sandwich belt conveyor high angle elevator</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>The design and construction was carried out under Cortex's
    responsibility to Flinders Ports. It included the Snake Sandwich high angle
    belt elevator system technology developed by Dos Santos International of the
    USA. Cortex constructed the Snake Sandwich system under DSI's supervision
    and assembled it within the Cortex mobile ship-loader assembly.</p>

    <p>The system is rated at 1000tph and is totally relocatable anywhere on the
    wharf and can be configured as a left or right hand feeder to loader
    arrangement to suit the ship berth location, hold location and the tip truck
    traffic flow.</p>
