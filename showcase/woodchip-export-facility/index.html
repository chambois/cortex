    <h2>Woodchip export facility</h2>

    <p>CORTEX RESOURCES PTY LTD and Fletcher Constructions of New Zealand
    formed a joint venture to design and construct a new shiploading system
    for Northland Port Corporation at Marsden Point in the North Island of New
    Zealand.  The system includes
      <ul>
        <li>Mobile shiploader</li>
        <li>Modular, dismantlable wharf conveyor and tripper system</li>
        <li>Fixed conveyors to move material to the wharf</li>
        <li>Chain conveyor reclaim system</li>
        <li>Pad storage for woodchips.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p> The entire conveying system is rated at 1,000 t/h of woodchips
    (approximately 2,500m3/h).  The shiploader is mobile and designed for high
    sided Panamax vessels. The modular, wharf conveyor and tripper system
    incorporates easily dismantles skid mounted conveyor units that can be removed
    from the wharf area to make way for other wharf users. The tail section of the
    wharf conveyor pivots and can be tucked up against the fixed transfer conveyor
    to allow free access to the wharf. This allows easy, repeatable alignment of
    the important transition area between the fixed conveyor chute and the wharf
    conveyor/tripper</p>
